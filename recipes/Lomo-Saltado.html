<h3>Peruvian Lomo Saltado Recipe</h3>
<p>Making the best Lomo Saltado recipe comes down to picking the right meat. While I personally feel that the best Lomo Saltado is made with alpaca meat, finding alpaca outside of Peru isn’t always the easiest. And that’s why most Lomo Saltado is made with beef.</p>
<p>Traditional Lomo Saltado is made with loin cuts. In fact, the word Lomo is Spanish for “loin.” The trick to choosing the best loin cut for Lomo Saltado is finding a cut that is both tender and that cooks quickly. Cooking these cuts too long dries out the meat, so finding small cuts of sirloin or tenderloin offer a tender result that is sure to please your dinner guests.</p>
<p>Combining tender slices of beef, crunchy onions, and ripe tomatoes, this Peruvian Lomo Saltado recipe is the ideal Chines-Peruvian stir-fry.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 lbs beef tenderloin (sliced into 1/2-inch cuts across the grain). Can be substituted for skirt steak or other tender, quick-cooking cuts of beef, alpaca, or llama.</li>
    <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 tsp kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 large Spanish onion. Cut into 1.2-inch slices.</li>
    <li>8 scallions with roots trimmed. Cut into 2-inch lengths.</li>
    <li>1 aji pepper. Stemmed, seeded, and sliced into thin strips.</li>
    <li>2 large plum tomatoes. Cored and cut into 1/2-inch thick slices.</li>
    <li>4 cloves of garlic. Minced.</li>
    <li>1 piece of ginger (approx 1.5"). Peeled and grated.</li>
    <li>1 tbsp + 1 tsp soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
    <li>2 tsp fresh cilantro leaves with stems. Minced.</li>
    <li>Black pepper (to taste).</li>
    <li>4 large yellow potatoes. Sliced into thick-cut fries.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Heat your wok over medium-high heat. Once hot, add 2 tbsp of oil to your wok (if you don't have a wok you can use a skillet or large cast-iron pan).</li>
    <li>Working in batches so as not to overcrowd, pan-sear the meat. Try to spread the beef around the wok to ensure that the pieces cook evenly (approx 1-minute). Once finished, move the cooked meat to a plate. Continue until all of the meat is cooked.</li>
    <li>Once the meat is cooked, heat your wok over high heat. Once hot, add 1 tbsp of oil and allow to heat.</li>
    <li>Working in batches so as not to overcrowd, add the onion. Cook, allowing the onion to move about the pan until it is tender-crisp (approx 30 seconds). Transfer cooked onion to a plate and continue until all onion is cooked (add more oil when necessary).</li>
    <li>Once the onion has been cooked, heat your wok over high heat. Once hot, add 1 tbsp of oil and allow to heat.</li>
    <li>Working in batches so as not to overcrowd, add scallions and sear on one side (do not stir them)(approx 30 seconds).</li>
    <li>Once the scallions are seared add the aji peppers and cook until seared (approx 30 seconds).</li>
    <li>Once the scallions and peppers are cooked, add the tomatoes to the wok. Allow them to sear on one side (approx. 30 seconds). If you find that the peppers and scallions are being overcooked, you can move them to a plate before doing this.</li>
    <li>Add garlic and ginger to the tomatoes and cook, stirring constantly until fragrant (approx 15-20 seconds).</li>
    <li>Add soy sauce and vinegar (and peppers and scallions if they were removed). Toss to coat.</li>
    <li>Return the beef and onions to the wok (ensure that you include all of the juices as well). Mix the ingredients together.</li>
    <li>Add cilantro. Toss over high heat.</li>
    <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat once finished.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Preuvian Style Fries</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 450°F.
    Sprinkle potatoes with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Spread the potato slices on a baking pan and cook fully for about 30-minutes.</li>
    <li>Once the potatoes are cooked, remove the potatoes from the oven.</li>
    <li>Heat a deep pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add oil and allow it to heat.</li>
    <li>Fry the potatoes until they are golden brown on all sides (approx. 2-minutes). Remember that the potatoes are already cooked, this is just to make them crispy on the outside.</li>
